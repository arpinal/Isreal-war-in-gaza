        <h1>Isreal's War in Gaza</h1>
        <p> Mohammad Deif , the head of Hamas's military wing, the <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/02/the-pace-of-israels-war-in-gaza-far-exceeds-previous-conflicts"> Qassam Brigades</a> , said in a recorded message on 7 October that it was in response to what he called the "desecration" of the <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/attacks-on-israel-will-end-if-gaza-war-stops-iran-at-davos-meet-4880810">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a>, and Israel  <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-14/israel-gaza-war-approach-100-days-netanyahu-healthcare/103317960">killing</a> and wounding hundreds of Palestinians in 2023. Israel-Hamas War of 2023, war between Israel and Palestinian militants, especially <b>Hamas</b>  and the <b>Palestinian Islamic Jihad</b> , that began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a land, sea, and air assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip.

  Since 2001, Palestinian militants have launched thousands of rocket and mortar  <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/poll-most-americans-fear-broader-conflict-may-arise-from-war-between-israel-and-hamas">attacks</a> on Israel from the Gaza Strip, <em> killing, injuring, and traumatizing</em> Israeli civilians. In July 2006, Israel briefly re-occupied parts of northern Gaza Strip and used the occupied areas as bases for  <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/13/middleeast/israel-gaza-hamas-war-friday-intl-hnk/index.html">raids</a> into <b>Jabalya</b> and <b>Beit Lahya</b>.  About 100,000 Palestinians have been <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-gaza-preventative-war/">killed</a>, reported missing, or wounded since October 7 2023 due to Israel's ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip, Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor said in a statement on Saturday, noting that the number includes those who now have long-term disabilities.
